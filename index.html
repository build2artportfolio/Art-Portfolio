                            We provide a centralized location where our artists can showcase their work to the world. 
                            TheLookBook is a new platform for artists to display their personal content to the world in a cohesive manner that allows them to connect with their audience in a user-friendly fashion. 
                            The art is stored in a database that allows artists and users alike to view posts from our wide range of artists. 
                        </p>
                        <p class = "sales-pitch">
                            TheLookBook offers artists a way to create their own unique profile and then publish their own content by uploading their work to our application which is then stored in our database. 
                            Once an artist has created their profile, and proceeded to uploaded and posted their work, users are then able to visit each unique profile and view an artist's published work.
